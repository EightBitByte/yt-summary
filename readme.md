# yt-summary : YouTube Video Summary Creator

> ✨ An AI-enhanced app that reads a YouTube video URL and prints a summary of the video's spoken content.

❗ This application is currently in progress, as of January 4th, 2024 ❗ 

## Planned Features
- Web hosting for the application
- Unlimited use of the app, completely free
- Fine-tuning of summary detail

## History
I first came up with this idea as I was watching educational YouTube videos about "5 tips to improve your code structure," or something vaguely interesting and useful like that. I noticed that the video was almost twenty minutes in length, so I wanted a tl;dr of the video. I then plugged the YouTube video's transcript into ChatGPT and was surprised with the results.

It's no secret that Artificial Intelligence is going to revolutionize the way we learn information, and what better way of doing that than juicing the very essence of YouTube videos down to their core.

This is not meant to replace the video in and of itself, however! Creators work very hard not only on the audial aspect of their videos, but also on the visual part of them as well. This application can be used as a synopsis of the video, to gauge interest in the subject, perhaps.
